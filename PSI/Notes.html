<p>
Professional bodies
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Professionals (e.g., architects, engineers, medics) must accept responsibility for their actions, especially when a mistake could be disastrous.</li>
<li>A professional body is an organisation that promotes high standards in a particular profession.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Examples of IT-related professional bodies:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ACM (US-based but international membership)</li>
<li>BCS (UK)</li>
<li>IEEE (US-based but international membership; electrical/telecommunications/computer engineering)</li>
<li>IET (UK; electrical/computer engineering)</li>

<li>Each professional body publishes a code of conduct, and requires its members to adhere to it.</li>
<li>The professional body can suspend or expel members for serious breaches of its code of conduct.</li>
<li>In some professions (e.g., medicine), suspension or expulsion entails loss of the right to practice.</li>
<li>In software engineering, this is not (yet) the case.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
'Display Screen' - Just means a Monitor or equivalent
</p>

<p>
Regulations apply to DSE users
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DSE users are employees that use display screen equipment continuously for an hour or more in a single working day.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Regulations do not apply to employees that use DSE for short periods of time or use it infrequently.
</p>

<p>
Display Screen Equipment (DSE) are equipment or devices that contains or includes a display.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Alphanumeric display</li>
<li>Graphical display</li>
<li>Laptops</li>
<li>Touch screens.</li>
</ul>

<p>
DSE users are exposed to potential health risks
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Eye strain</li>
<li>Sore limbs or back ache</li>
</ul>

<p>
Employees can be exposed to such risks through DSE devices and equipment.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Overuse</li>
<li>Improper use</li>
<li>Badly designed workstations</li>
<li>Poorly developed environments</li>
</ul>

<p>
Employers can work with DSE users to avoid potential health risks.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify risks</li>
<li>Develop and implement practical controls</li>
<li>Commit to healthy working.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Employers should consult and communicate with DSE regards issues as well as providing relevant information.
</p>

<p>
Employers should consider:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Special requirements of the employee.</li>
<li>Role of employee or task being performed.</li>
<li>Environment, not just the DSE itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Employers do not need to ask employees to assess risk for temporary home working, but employees should inform employers of any discomfort.
</p>

<p>
Employers should support employees in conducting complete risk assessments for long-term or permanent home working arrangements.
</p>

<p>
Regulations operate from the premise that DSE work will not result in permanent damage to eyesight or eyes. 
</p>

<p>
DSE users can request eye tests, employers are expected to provide tests and supply eyewear (if necessary for DSE work). 
</p>

<p>
Employers may dictate that employees access a nominated optician or they may opt to allow employees to provide bill for expense. 
</p>

<p>
Employers under the regulations, must:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Analyse workstations and assess as well as reduce risk.</li>
<li>Ensure appropriate controls are in place.</li>
<li>Ensure employees have sufficient information and training.</li>
<li>Provide eyesight tests upon request, special eyewear if required.</li>
<li>Review the assessment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Employers must assess risk when:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DSE user complain.</li>
<li>DSE user commences a new role/position.</li>
<li>Environmental change impacts interaction with DSE.</li>
<li>New DSE is provided to employee.</li>
</ul>

<p>
DSE assessment must be reviewed, when:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Users change workstations.</li>
<li>The nature of work tasks changes considerably.</li>
<li>The current controls in place may be producing problems for the user.</li>
<li>Significant changes occur to the equipment, environment or system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Health and Safety Executive provide the DSE workstation checklist.
</p>

<p>
The checklist supports organisations in completing a risk assessment and complying with the legislation.
</p>

<p>
The DSE checklist assessment outlines a number of risks and other factors.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keyboards, mouse and trackballs.</li>
<li>Display screens.</li>
<li>Software considerations.</li>
<li>Furniture.</li>
<li>Environment.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Intolerable risk, elements need to abandoned, replaced or evolved to reduce vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Tolerable risk, risks have been reduced using solutions to as long as reasonably possible (ALARP).</li>

<p>
Risk types
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Routine risks, normal decision process that make use of statistics and data to inform decisions.</li>
<li>Complex risks, less obvious may need to gather more evidence and perform cost analysis.</li>
<li>Uncertain risks, lack of predictability and need to monitor impact and roll back any solutions.</li>

</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The contract may be verbal or written.</li>

<li><a id="org8bd088d"></a>Bespoke software development contracts<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-1-5-1">
<p>
Bespoke software is developed by a supplier for the exclusive use of one customer (or a consortium of customers).
The contract specifies the requirements and all deliverables (software, documentation, training, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Problem:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Requirements are always changing.</li>
<li>A contract is supposed to be definitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So the contract should explicitly allow for changing requirements at a price.
The contract should also define the customer’s and supplier’s IPR.
</p>

<p>
Copyright can apply only to code specifically developed for the customer:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not to open-source code</li>
<li>Not to standard library code</li>
<li>Not to generic code previously developed by the supplier</li>
<li>Not to boilerplate code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The contract might state that the supplier retains copyright but licences the customer to use it (perhaps exclusively).
The contract should state how the development project will be managed.
Each party should nominate a project manager, with authority to make decisions (including financial decisions up to some stated limit).
</p>

<p>
The contract should specify surcharges if:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The customer is late in providing resources or information to the supplier</li>
<li>The customer changes the requirements at a late stage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The contract should specify an acceptance procedure:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The customer must provide a set of test cases.</li>
<li>If the system performs these test cases correctly, it is accepted.</li>

All software contains faults (bugs).
Software suppliers try to limit their liability for any faults.
Typically:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the software proves to be completely unusable, the supplier agrees to refund the purchase price.</li>

The UK Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 makes liability-limiting terms enforceable in law only to the extent that they are reasonable.
</p>

<p>
A person injured as a result of faulty safety-critical software (or hardware) can sue the supplier for damages, regardless of any limitations stated in the contract/licence.
</p>

<p>
Even where software is not safety-critical, faults can cause significant economic damage. E.g.:

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-8">
<p>
Computer misuse means unauthorised access to any computer.
</p>

<p>
This can be by any means:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Physical access</li>
<li>Via the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This can be for any purpose:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>copying, modifying, or deleting data</li>
<li>modifying programs</li>
<li>disrupting normal operation.</li>

<p>
UK computer misuse laws
</p>

<p>
The Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA) was enacted to combat misuse.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: At that time Internet access was limited.</li>
</ul>

<p>
CMA created three new criminal offences:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unauthorised access to any program/data held in any computer</li>
<li>As above, with intent to commit a serious offence</li>
<li>Unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
CMA applies to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anyone anywhere who accesses a computer in UK</li>
<li>Anyone in UK who accesses a computer anywhere in the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Examples of offences:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Intentionally spreading a virus or worm</li>
<li>Modifying a company’s or individual’s web pages</li>
<li>Stealing sensitive personal data (e.g., for publication or blackmail)</li>
<li>Stealing commercially sensitive data</li>
<li>Disrupting a company’s commercial operations</li>
<li>Disrupting operations of an agency concerned with health or safety (e.g., emergency services or air traffic control).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Police and Justice Act 2006:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Increased maximum penalties for CMA offences</li>
<li>Amended CMA to cover intent to impair operation of any computer</li>
<li>Amended CMA to cover software tools intended to facilitate computer misuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>
New offences:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Denial-of-service attacks</li>
<li>Building or selling hackers’ toolkits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Experience of computer misuse laws
</p>

<p>
Convictions have been infrequent. Penalties have been lenient:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Never more than 3 years (even in the NoW phone hacking case)</li>
<li>Maximum penalty is 10 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Police are over-stretched. To investigate suspected offences, they must engage (expensive) security experts.
</p>

<p>
Companies that are attacked often prefer to keep quiet, to avoid drawing attention to their security weaknesses.

Exemption from the CMA and other acts may be permitted if the actions relate to state defence or criminal investigation.
Actions taken that have state authorisation, e.g. warrant, would be exempted from specific laws.
Liability for actions may be exempted to the extent that is expressed by the state authorisation, i.e. want the warrant permits. 
Example: warrant issued in line with the (UK) Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) 2016 would be exempt from criminal liability under the (UK) Computer Misuse Act (CMA) 1990.

Intellectual Property
Video Transcript Explanation
These are thefts of intellectual property (IP).
Thefts of IP are covered by special laws, known as intellectual property rights (IPR).
IP is particularly easy to take across national boundaries, so international laws are essential.
This was recognised long ago:
Paris Convention 1883, covering trade marks and patents
Berne Convention 1886, covering copyright.
Most (but not all) countries have signed these conventions.
Intellectual Property Rights are negative rights as they demand someone does not perform an activity.
Registered IPRs are approved or granted by states, typically by some official entity.
patents
trademarks
Unregistered IPRs come into existence and are not approved or granted by states.
Copyright
Public domain, in the context of IPR, essentially means no IPR exists.

Video Transcript Explanation
In UK, the primary law is the Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA).
CDPA protects:
original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works
sound recordings, films, TV programmes.
Copyright lasts up to 70 years after the author’s death.
CDPA classifies software as a literary work! – Only original code is protected.
Boilerplate code is not protected.
An unregistered right that comes into effect upon the creation of original work.
The scope of copyright is typically restricted to the expression of an idea, not so much the idea itself.
At the turn of the century scope was expanded to permit legal action against interference with measures designed to protect copyright.

<li><a id="orgbedb5a1"></a>Copyright ownership<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-2-1">
<p>
The author owns the copyright, unless the author did the work for his/her employer.
If the author is an independent contractor, he/she owns the copyright unless the contract says otherwise.
The copyright owner has exclusive rights:
to make copies of the work (including download of a web page)
to sell, rent, lend, or give away copies of the work
to adapt the work (including translation to a different language).
Others must seek permission from the copyright owner.
In some cases permission is implicit. (E.g., downloading a web page is permitted, but not storing it permanently.)

If someone reveals information obtained under an obligation of confidence, he/she can be sued in a civil court.
Examples:
Employees must not reveal confidential information about their employer’s business.
When a company engages a contractor or consultant, the contract will normally include a confidentiality clause.
When two companies are discussing possible collaboration, they will sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect exchanged information.

Sometimes the “public interest” overrides an obligation of confidence. This makes it possible for employees (whistle-blowers) to expose wrong-doing.
The UK Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) provides protection for whistle-blowers who expose:
criminal offences
failure to comply with legal obligations – danger to health and safety
environmental damage
concealment of the above.
The whistle-blower must first approach the employer, then a professional body or public official (not the media!).

Video Transcript Explanation
A patent is a temporary right for an inventor to prevent others from exploiting his/her invention without permission.
The inventor must apply for a patent to a national patenting office.
If the patent is granted, the details of the invention will be published.
This will enable anyone to exploit the invention after the patent has expired.
In UK, CDPA covers patents. It allows a patent to be granted only if the invention is:
new (not previously disclosed or used publicly) – inventive (non-obvious)
capable of industrial application
not in an excluded area.
</p>

<p>
The European Patent Convention lists excluded areas:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anything covered by copyright</li>
<li>Scientific theories</li>
<li>Mathematical methods</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-4-1">
<p>
Nevertheless, the European Patent Office has granted software patents. And individual countries have a variety of policies. Result: confusion!
Arguments for and against software patents:
It is illogical to grant a patent for a hardware device but deny it for a device that uses software to do the same thing.
Patents reward research and development, and encourage investment in novel technologies.
Much software development is done by small companies, who cannot afford to defend patents in court.
In practice, software development has not been inhibited by lack of patents.

Video Transcript Explanation
The UK Trade Marks Act 1994 provides protection for trade marks.
It defines a trade mark as:
any sign capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. A trade mark may, in particular, consist of words (including personal names), designs, letters, numerals or the shape of goods or their packaging.
Trade marks can be registered with the UK Intellectual Property Office, or its equivalent in other countries.
Selling anything with an unauthorised trade mark is a criminal offence in the countries where it is registered.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-5-1">
<p>
Software is now usually distributed without physical packaging.
To protect the producer, the software should display the trade mark prominently whenever it runs.
Selling pirated software that displays the genuine producer’s trade mark is then a criminal offence.

Video Transcript Explanation
Trade secrets can be protected indefinitely, as long as they are kept secret.
If such secrets become public, securing a patent is unlikely.
Owners of trade secrets can take legal action
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Against those that misappropriate their secrets.</li>
<li>Against those that utilise such secrets, e.g. a third-party.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Trade secrets are typically protected under general tort law.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Valuable information that is not widely known.</li>
<li>Valuable information that delivers benefit to the holder, because it has been kept secret.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Empowering those that have been a reasonable attempt to keep their secrets against those that have utilised, obtained and/or revealed without authorisation.
In the US, there has been increasing legal harmonisation around trade secrets across the country.
The (US) Economic Espionage Act (1996) is designed to counter trade secret theft.
In European law, that has also been increasing legal harmonisation around trade secrets across member states.
Directive 2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure.
Trade secret holders can use a range of tactics to kept information secret, including technology and legal tools.
Legal tools include the use of non-disclosure agreements (though such a tool may not be that effective).
The motivation for favouring trade secrets over patents is that companies can exploit their innovation for an indefinite period of time.
Risk being able to prevent others from exploiting the innovation through reverse engineering.

Reverse engineering can be considered the lawful approach to obtain trade secrets.
promotes the use of patents if trade secret owners want to secure income.
promotes economic activity through competition and innovation without impacting significantly on the creator.
Misappropriation of trade secrets, using tactics such as bribery or espionage, is not fair game.
Scientific investigation on something purchased publicly to reveal its secrets is generally perceived as acceptable.
Reverse engineering is typically perceived as an accepted practice in IPR, but does differ depending on the form.

researchers could have purchased car and reversed engineered algorithm using chip-slicing.
researchers instead reversed a third-party software that was used by mechanics for diagnostic purposes.
individuals keen to maintain the trade secret status of their work, sought to prevent researchers from disseminating their work.
Court agreed that researchers could have reversed engineered the algorithm via chip-slicing, this would be fair game.
Court stated that instead the researchers had actually reversed engineered a software product – that was likely itself only created through improper use of trade secrets.
Researchers probably knew or should have known that such a product only existed due to such improper use.

Retail software is intended for a mass market.
The price is modest (typically up to £500).
The buyer receives one copy of the software with a licence to install it on one computer.
The licence does not cover maintenance or upgrades.
An organisation might prefer to negotiate a bulk licence.
The price is correspondingly higher.
The organisation is entitled to install the software on multiple computers.
The licence might limit the number of installations, or the number of simultaneous users.

Video Transcript Explanation
• Profile profiling can be considered as extracting patterns through automated processing of large volumes of personal data using algorithms and mathematical techniques to analyze aspects of individuals. Now these aspects could include elements such as their personality, their habits, their behaviors. These patterns are extracted from this analysis can go on to form profiles and these profiles can be incorporated into decision making.
</p>

<p>
• Process is by organizations. Now these profiles can be generated from a variety of data sources. Some of these data sources are conventional, were aware of them, such as, say, those on social networks in terms of the messages are individuals post the images they post of who they say. The friends are and what they're doing and what their thoughts are.
</p>

<p>
It can also include web browsing history and these would probably be more familiar with, but there's also data sources that are busing less conventional, or we may not think of such as video surveillance footage or data taken from sensors and the home or outside in public spaces. And it could also come the home or outside in public spaces. And it could also come from data sources that are being added all the time, so it's important to appreciate all the while we talked about just four data sources there. The data that was able to generate these profiles can come from a wide variety of data sources to make them hopefully more effective.
</p>

<p>
Now these profiles can be used as part of a decision making
process by organizations to make the sessions about people
and those decisions could be could this person afford alone. It
could also be used to predict behavior as the individual in front
of me going to reoffend. Are we going to commit another crime
if I let it go, or should I hold on to them? And they can also be
used to determine individual preferences. Disaster individual
want to see this at the top of the last versus something else at
the bottom versus another individual now cause in the context
we're talking about profiling encompasses use of personal
data, it comes into scope of data protection legislation and in
the European context that is the general data protection
regulations. Specifically, article four defines profiling as any
form of automated processing of personal data consisting of
the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects
relating to a natural person and particular to analyze or predict
aspects concerning that natural persons performance at work,
economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests,
reliability, behavior, location or movements. We're talking about
an individual versus illegal person, which could be a private
company or an organization so the important point there is that
general cause these profiles can utilize personal data they
enact or common scope of the general data protection
regulations in the European context, and you can appreciate
that because the impact revolve quite serious situations, we
can apply or organization can apply these profiles to make
predictions about individuals that can make this elections that
have impacts on their life in terms of if they get alone. Or if
they're going to go into jail.
</p>

<p>
• Important point: a profile can be used for more than just
marketing. It can be used for a wide range of tasks.
• Extracting patterns through automated processing of large volumes
of personal data.

• Using algorithms and techniques to analyse aspects of individuals.

• The (UK) Equality Act 2010 aims to progress equality and protect
the rights of individuals from discrimination.
• The Act incorporates and supersedes many prior pieces of
legislation:
◦ The Equal Pay Act 1970
◦ The Sex Discrimination Act 1975
◦ The Race Relations Act 1976
◦ The Disability Discrimination Act 1995
◦ The Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003
◦ The Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations

◦ The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006
◦ The Equality Act 2006, Part 2
◦ The Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007
(UK) Equality Act 2010 outlaws discrimination on protected
characteristics
◦ Age; disability; gender reassignment; marriage and civil
partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race, colour, ethnic
origin or nationality; religion or belief; sex; sexual orientation.
• Discrimination can be categorised as direct or indirect.
• Direct discrimination is when an individual is treated differently than
another because of a protected characteristic.
• Indirect discrimination is when a decision for everyone has a
different impact on individuals that share a protected characteristic.
• Discrimination can be permitted under the (UK) Equality Act 2010,
if there is a legitimate reason.
• An individual can justify discrimination under the (UK) Equality Act
2010, if they can demonstrate it is a proportionate means to
achieve a legitimate aim.
• Individuals can test if discrimination is permitted under the (UK)
Equality Act 2010 in court.

• The GDPR restricts the use of solely automated decision-
making that has legal impact or similar significant effect on an
individual.
• Solely means the decision making process has no human
involvement and is completely automated.
• The process is still considered solely automated if humans are
involved in the entry of data.
• The process would not be considered solely automated, if the
outcome is considered by a human being as part of the decision
process.
• Human inclusion must be significant to avoid being deemed solely
automated.
• A human must have the potential to consider and alter the decision
before application, rather than just blindly approving automated
decisions.
• An automated decision having legal impact is a decision that
affects the legal rights of an individual.
• A decision that has similar significant effect that impacts on the
individual.
• Automated-decision making is permitted under specific
circumstances.
circumstances.
• Organisations also have additional responsibilities when utilising
automated decision-making.
• Organisations must:
◦ develop processes that allow individuals to exercise rights
◦ put safeguards in place
◦ inform the individual about the use of automated decision- making process and profiling.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-5">
<p>
Video Transcript Explanation
In this context communications include:
• Letters
• Phone calls
• Text messages
• E-mail messages
• Anything posted on a blog or social network
</p>

<p>
Communications data are defined as:
• Identities of senders and receivers
• Their locations
• Dates and times
• Size or durations
• But not the content of communications

<li><a id="orge92917b"></a>UK Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA)<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-5-1">
<p>
RIPA created a framework for controlling lawful interception of computer/phone/postal communications:
• by specified public agencies (police, intelligence, tax collection), but only for preventing or detecting serious crime
</p>

<p>
• by communication service providers (CSPs) and employers, but only for specified legitimate reasons
</p>

<p>
RIPA permits any organisation providing computer/phone services
(e.g. an ISP or employer) to monitor and record users’
communications, for legitimate reasons. Legitimate reasons include:
• ensuring compliance with the organisations regulations and procedures
• upholding standards e.g. calls monitored for training purposes
• preventing or detecting crime e.g. theft, fraud
• investigating/detecting unauthorised use of communication systems
</p>

<p>
Users must be told that such interceptions may take place.
RIPA permits specified public agencies to intercept communications:
• only for specified purposes, such as preventing/detecting serious crime
• only with a warrant granted by a senior official, identifying the suspect persons or organisations
</p>

<p>
Originally only police, intelligence, and tax agencies could seek
warrants, was alter extended to numerous other public agencies.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-1-4-5-1-1">
<p>
RIPA has been criticised by some MPs and campaign groups for excessive intrusion. But has also been critised by intelligence agencies for not going far enough.
Blanket surveillance was ruled illegal by the EU court of justice in 2014:
“The Court takes the view that, by requiring the retention of those
[communications] data and by allowing the competent national
authorities to access those data, the directive interferes in a
particularly serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for
private life and to the protection of personal data. [&#x2026;]”

The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 reforms interception of communication:
• brought together all the powers available to intelligence and security services to obtain communications
• refines how these powers are monitored and authorised
• ensures Internet connection records can be retained for law enforcement purposes

<h4 id="org5296870"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.6.</span> Freedom of information</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-6">
<p>
Video Transcript Explanation
• The basic principle of freedom of information is that information
held by public bodies should be available to the public (with certain
exceptions).
• Key questions:
◦ Which public bodies should be covered?
◦ Which types of information should be covered? Which should be treated as exceptions?
• The Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FoIA) aimed:
◦ to provide clear rights of access to information held by bodies in the public sector
◦ to enable anyone to apply for access to such information.
• FoIA’s answers to the key questions:
◦ Public bodies include Parliament, all government departments, local authorities, NHS, universities, schools, etc.
◦ Information covered includes printed documents, electronic documents, e-mails, etc. Exceptions include classified documents.
• There’s a potential conflict between FoIA and DPA.
• Responding to FoIA requests can be extremely costly.

Video Transcript Explanation
• Anonymisation
◦ decoupling identification from information.
◦ achieving anonymisation is extremely difficult.
◦ labelling a data set as anonymised remains unclear.
• Generalisation
◦ reducing the precision of data to reduce the likelihood of informing identity.
◦ example: use of ranges.
• Suppression
◦ suppression information, making fewer data available to attacker to reduce inferences.
◦ example: suppression gender in 50% of data records.
• Dummy addition
◦ adding dummies or fake data points to data sets prior to providing to other party.
◦ example: artificial records.
• Perturbation
◦ adding noise to data to reduce the ability of other party to form inferences.
◦ example: differential privacy.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-7-2">
<p>
Video Transcript Explanation
• The Internet’s benefits are well-known:
◦ easy access to data of all types (text, images, video, audio)
◦ easy communication
◦ transcends national boundaries.
• But it also brings risks:
◦ some data might be harmful, even unlawful
◦ communication can be abused (e.g., by criminals and “trolls”)
◦ regulation is difficult (because it transcends boundaries)!

<li><a id="org1380d66"></a>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-7-3">
<p>
• An internet service provider (ISP) provides access to the Internet for its customers (organisations and individuals).
• Can an ISP be held responsible for unlawful data up/downloaded by its customers?
• EU law (Directive 2000/31/EC) distinguishes between:
◦ mere conduit
◦ caching
◦ hosting.
• Mere conduit: The ISP simply transmits data up/downloaded by the customer.
◦ Then the ISP is not liable for damages or criminal sanctions.
• Caching: The ISP temporarily stores downloaded data, to speed up future downloading of the same data.
◦ Then the ISP is not liable for damages or criminal sanctions, provided that:
◦ it promptly removes or blocks access to cached data when
informed that the original data had been removed/blocked, or a
court/authority has ordered removal/blocking
◦ etc.
• Hosting: The ISP permanently stores data uploaded by its customers.
◦ Then the ISP is not liable for damages or criminal sanctions, provided that:
◦ it is unaware that unlawful data has been uploaded
◦ it promptly removes/blocks unlawful data as soon as it is discovered
◦ the customer who uploaded unlawful data was not acting on the ISP’s authority
◦ etc.
• When an ISP receives a complaint, how does it judge whether data is unlawful?
• If the complainant is a powerful organisation or individual, the ISP might prefer to play safe.
• Example:
◦ A freelance journalist uploads an article alleging that an arms company is ignoring an international arms embargo.
◦ The arms company claims that this is defamation, and demands that the hosting ISP remove the article.
◦ The ISP cannot evaluate the journalist’s detailed evidence.
◦ The ISP might decide to remove the article, just to avoid time- consuming and expensive legal action.

<li><a id="org75887c6"></a>Internet Watch Foundation (IWF)<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-7-4">
<p>
• IWF’s remit includes defamatory material, child abuse images,
unlawful adult material, etc.
• Anyone can report any potentially unlawful content to IWF.
• If IWF judges that the content is unlawful, it informs the local police
(or Interpol) and the hosting ISP.
• If the hosting ISP is outside UK, IWF asks all its member ISPs in
UK to block access to the unlawful content.
• Example:
◦ An arms company submits its claim of defamation to IWF.
◦ IWF experts judge whether the claim is justified or not.
◦ If the claim is held to be unjustified, the ISP can safely disregard it.

<li><a id="orgaa9be83"></a>Law in different countries<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-7-5">
<p>
Video Transcript Explanation
• US law on ISPs is much looser than EU law. Liability for hosting is
the same as liability for mere conduit.
• What is unlawful content varies widely from country to country.
• But the Internet transcends national boundaries.
◦ In principle, anyone in country A can access data hosted in
another country B (even if the data is lawful in B but unlawful in
A).
◦ Authoritarian governments often try to block access to
deprecated hosts. But determined users can get round such
blocks.
• Council of Europe has approved a convention that covers:
◦ Child pornography
◦ Criminal copyright infringement
◦ Computer-related fraud
◦ Hacking
◦ Hate material.
• Ratified by 39/51 member countries
◦ Including USA and some other countries outside Europe.
• But USA opted out of the hate material clause
◦ Constitutional right to freedom of speech.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-8">
<p>
Video Transcript Explanation
• Defamation is communication of a false statement that harms the
reputation of an individual, group, or organisation.
• Some countries (e.g., England) distinguish between:
◦ slander (spoken defamation)
◦ libel (written defamation, including e-mail, blogs, tweets, etc.)
• Other countries (e.g., Scotland) make no such distinction.
• In some countries, criticism of government ministers is treated as defamation.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-9">
<p>
Video Transcript Explanation
• Before the Internet, porn was relatively easy to control:
◦ photos and videos recorded on film had to be developed, using specialised equipment
◦ police could raid shops suspected of storing porn.
• Now, porn is very difficult to control:
◦ ubiquitous digital cameras
◦ enormous size of Internet.
• There is a wide variation in laws:
◦ In USA, porn is protected by the constitutional right to freedom
of speech (!).
◦ In Europe, adult porn is usually lawful, provided that it is non-
violent, consensual, and inaccessible to children.
◦ In some other countries, all porn is unlawful (and even nudity or scanty dress).
• But there is one consensus:
In nearly all countries, possessing or communicating child porn is a criminal offence.

<h4 id="orgfff233a"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.10.</span> Spam</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-10">
<p>
Video Transcript Explanation
• Spam is unsolicited e-mail, sent without consent of recipients, and
with no attempt to target only recipients likely to be interested.
• Various purposes:
◦ sales (dubious medications, treatments, investments, etc.)
◦ spreading viruses
◦ fraud or identity theft (attempting to discover private
information).
• In EU law (EC Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications
2002):
◦ Unsolicited e-mail can be sent to individuals only with prior
consent.
◦ Unsolicited e-mail must not conceal the sender’s true address.
◦ A seller may use e-mail addresses obtained in the normal
course of business, but must make it easy for recipients to
request the seller to stop sending spam.
• Onus is on spammers to seek prior consent.
◦ But does not apply to senders outside EU (90% of all spam).
◦ Also hard to enforce: individuals must take their own action,
even against large companies.
• In US law (CAN-SPAM Act 2003), spam is lawful if:
◦ The recipient has not asked the sender to stop.
◦ The unsolicited e-mail contains a valid e-mail address to
request that the sender to stop.
• This is weaker than EU law:
◦ No prior consent is required.
◦ Onus is on the recipient to respond, but this inadvertently confirms that the recipient’s e-mail address is still valid.
• But US law does have teeth:
◦ ISPs can and do sue spammers for damages.
◦ Spammers have been imprisoned and fined.
